- 📅 **View Progress**: Visualize your improvements over time with charts.
- 🏃 **Cardio Tracking**: Record running, cycling, or other cardio activities.
- 📁 **Data Storage**: Save progress using CSV or a lightweight database.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly UI**: Simple and intuitive interface using Streamlit.
- 🔹 Workflow of an ML-Based Fitness Tracker
1️⃣ Data Collection

User inputs workout data (exercise type, duration, calories burned).
Wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches) can provide heart rate, steps, sleep patterns, etc.
External APIs (e.g., Google Fit, Fitbit API) can supplement the data.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values and outliers.
Normalizing and scaling the data for better ML performance.
Feature engineering (e.g., converting timestamps into day-wise trends).
3️⃣ Applying Machine Learning Models

Linear Regression:	Predicts calorie burn	Estimate calories for a given exercise duration
Decision Trees/Random Forest:	Classifies workout intensity	Label workouts as Light, Moderate, or Intense
4️⃣ Real-Time Tracking & Feedback

The ML model continuously updates predictions based on new user data.

🔹 Tech Stack for ML-Based Fitness Tracker
🔹 Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib
🔹 Backend: Flask / FastAPI (if needed for API integration)
🔹 Frontend: Streamlit for interactive UI
